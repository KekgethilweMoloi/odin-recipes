    <!--Ingredients list-->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 classic pizza dough <em>(wood-fired Italian style)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <b>Garlic pizza topping</b>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp garlic <em>(2 to 3 large, crushed)</em></li>
            <li>1/8 tsp table salt</li>
            <li>100 g mozzarella cheese <em>(tightly packed cup, grated)</em></li>
            <li>50 g parmesan <em>(tightly packed cup, grated)</em></li>
        </ul>

    <!--Steps-->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat oven</b> to 250°C (230°C fan). Allow time to get it hot!!</li>
            <li><b>Garlic infused oil - </b>Mix olive oil and garlic in a small bowl. Set aside to infuse with flavour for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Pizza base - </b>Make and roll out the pizza base, stretch onto pan. <em>(Recipe Notes)</em></li>
            <li><b>Top - </b>Spread oil (and all garlic) onto the base, leaving the crust baked. Sprinkle with salt, 
                parmesan then mozzarella. (If using no-yeast base, spray/brush exposed crust with olive oil.)</li>
            <li><b>Bake </b>8 minutes, turning after 4 minutes, or until the the cheese has golden spots. Cut and eat!</li>

                
        </ol>

    <!--Recipe notes-->
    <h3>Recipe notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pizza base - </b> Classic pizza dough (yeast) – 5 min hand knead or stand-mix, plus 4 to 6 hours rising time (across 2 rises)</li>
            <li><b>Garlic - </b> For the best results, we want the garlic in a paste form so it fully infuses the oil with flavour. If you don’t have a garlic crusher, finely mince the garlic using your knife then smear it into a paste using the side of the knife.</li>
            <li><b>Cheese - </b>3. Cheese notes – Freshly shredded melts / spreads better because pre-shredded in packets are coated with anti-clumping agents. If using cups for measuring, shred first then pack it in tightly else you’ll be short – so sad. I cut hunks of cheese, weigh, then grate.</li>
